The project involves the implementation of the RISC-V instruction set Processor on FPGAs, accompanied by the creation of a dedicated software tool for fault injection and tracking. The pre-designed 32-bit RISC-V processor exported from Xilinx Vivado is imported to the YOSYS Open Synthesis Suite to export the RISC-V processor gate-level Verilog module. These files exported from YOSYS Syntheis tool can be imported into the software framework, which could process the SCAN chain, enabling simple gate-level test generation for the PODEM algorithm for both combinational and sequential circuits. This tool incorporates essential features such as stuck-at-zero and stuck-at-one fault simulation and utilizes the ATPG PODEM algorithm for efficient fault tracking and input test vector generation.
