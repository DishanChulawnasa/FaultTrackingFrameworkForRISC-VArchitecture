# FaultTrackingFrameworkForRISC-VArchitecture
The project involves developing a fault injection and tracking framework for the RISC-V-based processor. RISC-V is an open computer architecture that is becoming increasingly popular in academia as well as industry. Our software enables controlled fault introduction and behavior analysis at the circuit level or at the system level. Detecting faults helps enhance IC production quality and characterizes the behavior for specific applications. In this process, the Verilog files, initially in behavioral design, are transformed into gate-level design. To test sequential circuits, the manual addition of scan chains is required. Flip-flops are removed from the circuits, and those serve as input points for the PODEM (path-oriented decision-making) and ATPG (automatic test pattern generation) algorithms, which generate input test vectors for potential fault nodes within the circuit. Faults are injected into the input Verilog files, and both faulty and fault-free outputs are recorded. The test vectors generated by the PODEM algorithm serve as inputs to assess the faulty outputs. By comparing these outputs with their fault-free counterparts, the presence of faults can be verified.
