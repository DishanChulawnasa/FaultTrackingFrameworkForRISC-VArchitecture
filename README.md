# FaultTrackingFrameworkForRISC-VArchitecture
The research project involves the implementation of the RISC-V instruction set processor on FPGAs, accompanied by the creation of a dedicated software tool for fault injection and tracking. The pre-designed 32-bit RISC-V processor exported from Xilinx Vivado is imported to the software framework developed in Visual Studio with C++ and Verilog HDL programming. The project uses open-source tools Yosys Open Synthesis Suite, Icarus Verilog, and RISC-V Emulators. The software framework contains main 6 C++ and Verilog tools so far: Verilog gate-level netlist generation, SCAN Chain implementation to sequential elements, Simple Gate-level Verilog to text conversion, Verilog fault injection mechanism, PODEM ATPG algorithm implementation for input test vector generation and fault injection and comparator tool for the output vectors.
